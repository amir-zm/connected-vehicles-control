# Vehicular Platooning Simulation Framework

This repository provides a modular MATLAB framework for simulating and analyzing connected vehicle platoons. The system includes components for:

- Initial condition generation (pre-platooning phase)
- Distributed control of follower vehicles
- Communication topology modeling
- Performance evaluation (comfort, safety, fuel, etc.)

## ðŸ“¦ Modules

### ðŸš¦ Initializer

Located in [`initializer/`](initializer/), this module simulates the leader trajectory and follower behavior before platooning begins. It outputs:

- Initial states for all follower vehicles
- Leaderâ€™s state at the time of platoon trigger

Useful for seamless integration into your downstream platoon controller.
