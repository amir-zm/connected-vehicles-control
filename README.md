# Connected Vehicles Control

This repository contains MATLAB-based tools and simulations for connected vehicles control. The project focuses on analyzing the performance and safety of vehicle platooning under various information flow topologies (IFTs). The tools include simulation of the control system, computation of shared control gains, evaluation of safety/performance metrics, and visualization of accumulated average metrics.

## Overview

The main objectives of the project are to:
- **Simulate a vehicle platoon** using various information Flow Topologies (IFTs).
- **Compute shared control gains** by comparing control gain tags across different IFTs.
- **Evaluate safety and performance metrics** such as:
  - **DRAC** (Deceleration Rate)
  - **TTC** (Time-to-Collision)
  - **InpuT** (Control Input Effort)
  - **ACC** (Acceleration)
  - **JRK** (Jerk)
  - **Settling Time**
- **Aggregate and visualize metrics** by computing cumulative mean and standard deviation values over a grid of control gains.
